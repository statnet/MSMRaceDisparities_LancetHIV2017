# Isolating the sources of racial disparities in HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Atlanta, GA: A modeling study

This repository contains the source to reproduce the analysis described in the abstract below.  In this model, we examine factors that contribute to the much higher HIV prevalence in Black MSM in Atlanta, GA.  

This model is written in the R programming language.  To utilize it, it is first necessary to install EpiModel:

## Abstract
### Background
In the United States, men who have sex men (MSM) are a most-affected risk group, with Black MSM (BMSM) experiencing markedly higher HIV prevalence than White MSM (WMSM). We created a simulation model to jointly evaluate the strength of existing hypotheses and data in explaining these disparities.
### Methods
A dynamic, stochastic agent-based network model of BMSM and WMSM ages 18-39 in Atlanta incorporated race-specific individual and dyadic- level prevention and risk behaviors, network attributes, and care patterns. We estimated parameters from two Atlanta-based studies of this population (n=1,117), supplemented by the literature. We modeled the ability for racial assortativity to generate or sustain HIV prevalence disparities, alone as well as in conjunction with scenarios of observed racial patterns in behavioral, care, and susceptibility parameters.
### Findings
Race-assortative mixing alone could not sustain a pre-existing disparity. Differences in care cascade, stigma-related behaviors, and CCR5 genotypes each contributed considerably to the disparity, but nearly half (45%) of the disparity remained unexplained. A scenario evaluating race-specific reporting differences was the only one to yield Black HIV prevalence similar to that observed.
### Interpretation
Racial assortativity is an inadequate explanation for observed disparities. Work to close the gap in the care cascade by race is imperative, as are efforts to increase serodiscussion and strengthen relationships among Black MSM especially. Further work is urgently needed to identify other sources and pathways of this disparity, integrate concomitant STI epidemics into models, and understand reasons for racial differences in behavioral reporting.
